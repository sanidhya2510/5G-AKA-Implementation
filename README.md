# 5G-AKA-Implementation

The primary aim of our project was to enhance the protocols used in the 5G 
Authentication. We engaged in comprehensive research, thoroughly reviewing a 
variety of research papers. We also studied tools like Proverif and Tamarin Prover
which were used in the research papers to present a formal analysis of the 5G-AKA 
Protocol. We have used Java as the primary language in the implementation of the 
protocol, and the suggested enhancements have been presented in the report 
below.
The project aims to implement, analyze, and assess the security aspects of a 5G 
authentication protocol 5G AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement). The protocol 
involves key components such as User Equipment (UE), Security Anchor Function 
(SEAF), Authentication Server Function (AUSF), and Unified Data Management 
(UDM). The project is implemented in Java Programming Language, and it has two 
run modes, with a UE and an Evil UE.

To execute the code run the following command: 
- `gradle run`

If gradle is not installed on your system you can use the gradle wrapper script instead: 
- Linux/macOS: `./gradlew run`
- Windows: `gradlew.bat run`
